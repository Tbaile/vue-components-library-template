# Template Vue 3 Library

I've had my share of hiccups when creating a library, from TS configurations to development environments, it seems that
since JS is so fast-paced, it's hard to keep up with the best practices. This is the reason why this template exists, to
provide a single source of truth for all the best practices and tools you need to create a library.

The library is configured with the following tools:

- Vue 3 (with TypeScript and JSX support)
- Vite (with customization to allow export of TypeScript types in `dist`)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Storybook 8
